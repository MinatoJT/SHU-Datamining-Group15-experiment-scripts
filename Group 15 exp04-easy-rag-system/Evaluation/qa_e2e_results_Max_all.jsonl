{"question": "Which treatment options are considered for high-risk or very high-risk local CSCC?", "reference_answer": "High-risk or very high-risk local CSCC is treated with Mohs surgery/PDEMA or standard excision, with consideration of radiation and/or systemic therapy if surgery is not possible.", "generated_answer": "The treatment options for high-risk or very high-risk local CSCC are:\n\n1. High-risk surgery: This involves removing the entire tumor from the affected area using a combination of curettage and electrodesiccation (C&E) or shave excision. It is recommended for patients who have had long-term corticosteroid use, HIV/AIDS, or undergone an organ transplant.\n\n2. Very high-risk surgery: This type of surgery requires more extensive removal of the tumor, including the surrounding tissue and lymph nodes. It is typically reserved for patients who have been diagnosed with high-risk CSCC and have not responded well to other treatments.", "similarity_cosine": 0.7176356911659241, "retrieved_doc_ids": [154, 155, 140], "retrieved_preview": [{"id": 154, "title": "Medical"}, {"id": 155, "title": "Medical"}, {"id": 140, "title": "Medical"}]}
